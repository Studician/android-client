# MyStudiez - Android

## For students, by students.ðŸŽ“

### Productivity and time-management tool for studentsðŸš€
Before the project was made, I, like many other students around me,
had always forgotten *what my homeworks had been*, *where my classes had taken place* or *when they had begun*.
Creating a solution for these problems is my main motivation, as they have caused me a lot of trouble.

### Tech usedâš™
The entire application is built using **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)** and for the layouts, it uses **XML**.

### FeaturesðŸ’»
In the up-to-date version of the app *(0.3.3)*
you can add your **classes**, **lessons**, **tasks** and upcoming **exams** to the app, but most importantly, you can set **reminders.** ðŸ¥³
