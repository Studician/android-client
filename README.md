## For students, by students.🎓
Before the project was made, I, like many other students around me,
had always forgotten *what my homeworks had been*, *where my classes had taken place* or *when they had begun*.
Creating a solution for these problems is my main motivation behind this project, as they have caused me a lot of trouble.
I decided to make this open source, this way everyone can contribute to it, everyone can request changes - and everyone could turn them into reality!\
As you've read it in the title: *For students, by students.*

## Tech used⚙
The entire application is built using **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)** and for the layouts, it uses **XML**.\
The application uses a **[SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)** database.\
**[Click](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xhEoIiWYa9Y49B4lh1xcfVynXXvYynAw/view?usp=sharing)** to view the database scheme.

## Code style👔
I don't use any special formatting, only the built-in code formatter by Android Studio. Before you commit anything, you must format your code.\
You can do that by pressing the following combinations:\
**Windows:** *`Ctrl`* + *`Alt`* + *`L`*\
**Linux:** *`Ctrl`* + *`Shift`* + *`Alt`* + *`L`*\
**macOS:** *`Option`* + *`Command`* + *`L`*

## Features💻
In the up-to-date version of the app *(0.3.3)*
you can add your **classes**, **lessons**, **tasks** and upcoming **exams** to the app, but most importantly, you can set **reminders**.

## Contribution🏗
New ideas are always welcomed!\
*Contribution guideline is on the way...*

## Installation💿
The preferred code editor is **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)**.\
You need to have a physical android device or emulator running Android 6 (*M, Marshmallow, API Level 23*) or higher.
After you plugged in the physical device or started the emulator (*Note that if you have a physical device you must turn on Developer Options and USB Debugging*)\
After you finished setting up everything, you need to select the device which you want to run the application on and click run!

## How to use?📚
As you have already read it, you can add your classes, lessons, tasks and exams to this app. Using the bottom navigation drawer you'll find four menu points. Those will be **Overview**, **Subjects**, **Tasks**, and **Exams**.
You can easily add classes, tasks and exams by tapping the **_+_** button at the bottom of the screen. (*Note that you need to have at least 1 class added in order to add any tasks or exams*)
