## For students, by students.🎓
Before the project was made, I, like many other students around me,
had always forgotten *what my homeworks had been*, *where my classes had taken place* or *when they had begun*.
Creating a solution for these problems is my main motivation behind this project, as they have caused me a lot of trouble.
I decided to make this open source, this way everyone can contribute to it, everyone can request changes - and everyone could turn them into reality!\
As you've read it in the title: *For students, by students.*

## Tech used⚙
The entire application is built using **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)** and for the layouts, it uses **XML**.
Documentation can be found [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html)\
The application uses a **[SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)** database.
Docs are available [here](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)\
**[Click](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xhEoIiWYa9Y49B4lh1xcfVynXXvYynAw/view?usp=sharing)** to view the app's database schema.

## Code style👔
I don't use any special formatting, only the built-in code formatter by Android Studio. Before you commit anything, you must format your code.\
You can do that by pressing the following combinations:\
**Windows:** *`Ctrl`* + *`Alt`* + *`L`*\
**Linux:** *`Ctrl`* + *`Shift`* + *`Alt`* + *`L`*\
**macOS:** *`Option`* + *`Command`* + *`L`*

## Features💻
In the up-to-date version of the app *(0.3.4.2)* you can add your classes, lessons, tasks and upcoming exams to the app and if you want to, you'll be notified at a selected time before each task/exam.

## Contribution🏗
If you experience any problems with the software, please open a new issue!
New ideas are always welcomed!\
*Contribution guidline is on the wqy*

## Installation💿
I use **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)** for development.\
You need to have a physical android device or emulator running Android 6 (*M, Marshmallow, API Level 23*), which is the minimum api-level, or higher.
After you plugged in the physical device or started the emulator (*Note that if you have a physical device you must turn on Developer Options and USB Debugging*), you need to select the device which you want to run the application on and click run!

## How to use?📚
As you have already read it, you can add your classes, lessons, tasks and exams to this app. Using the bottom navigation drawer you'll find four menu points. Those will be **Overview**, **Subjects**, **Tasks**, and **Exams**.
You can easily add classes, tasks and exams by tapping the **_+_** button at the bottom of the screen. (*Note that you need to have at least 1 class added in order to add any tasks or exams*)
